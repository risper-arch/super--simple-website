        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>Ezekiel experience has alot of contribution in the economy. He decsribed  A THEORY OF THE CONSUMPTION FUNTION  as articulation of permanent income hypothesis, the idea that a household consumption and savings decisions are more affected by changes in its permanent income than by income changes that household members perceive as tempolary or transitory. The permanent income hypothesis provided an explanations for some puzzles that had emerged in the impirical data concerning the relationship between the average and merginal prospensities to consume. it also helped to explain why for example, fiscal policy in the form of tax increase, if perceived as tempolary, might npt lead to inteded reductions in consumptions; instead, the increased tax might be financed out of savings, leaving consumption levels unchanged. That was Ezekiels experience and finding too.</p>
